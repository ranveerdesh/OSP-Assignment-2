Firstly, create the list of allocation and deallocation commands from the bash script run the command,
`./p2_gen 20 > datafile`

Compile all the code through the makefile using the command,
`make all`
this will compile all three files and create executables.

To run the code, run the executable files in the command line using the first arguement as "bestfit" or "firstfit" and the second arguement as "datafile", which is the file which contains the list generated by the bash script.
Ex:

`./bestfit firstfit datafile`
`./firstfit bestfit datafile`

`./firstfit firstfit datafile`
`./bestfit bestfit datafile`

To remove all the executable files and the cache use the makefile with the command,
`make clean`
